# Predicting Gentrification

This thought experiment will explore **gentrification**, a social phenomenon where affluent people move to lower-income neighborhoods.

## Instructions

In your groups, discuss the following questions:

* What signs might indicate that gentrification is happening?
*   cost of living
*   median income
*   population
*   types of opportunities
*   investment in infrastructure
*   changes in businesses
*   commute times

* What means can we use to determine how long the trend has been happening?
*   these pieces of data are trackable

* What proxies might we use to identify gentrification in nonobvious ways?
*   the type of people you meet in the area
*   members of the community
*   not sure about other areas of non-trackable data

* How might you create a visualization of this data to best “tell the story”?
*   a line graph to compare opportunities, cost of living and income in the area

Pay special attention to details like:

* What data will you use to build your model?
*   we can use a graph, 

* How will you retrieve the data?
*   public information, census data, 

* What is your final “story”?
*   it would depend what the data shows, if the cost of living increases substantially along with the median income, then there would an increase in gentrification, payroll
